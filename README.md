A simple and easy-to-use bot for monitoring and ordering products online.

NOTE: This is an unfinished project. Currently it can checkout products on Amazon, however with the recent surge in bots for high-demand products (ex: GPUs) a selenium implementation is generally too slow to be effective. The GUI serves as a basic skeleton to modify functionality for effectiveness.

*VOLUME WARNING: Program sounds an alarm when the product is available.*
